<h2>50<sup class="th">th</sup> Anniversary of Star Trek</h2>
<p>I made this website to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek airing on televistion in the 
1960s. My interest in Star Trek started right after the first movie of the reboot series came out in 
2009. The movie was amazing! My mom loved Star Trek growing up, so I decided to give it a shot. I began 
watching the Orginal Series and I've never looked back.</p>
<p> This website is divided into four sections. Most of the information on this site is going to be about 
the Orginal Series because that is my favorite series.The Home page (where we are now) is just an overview
 of the site and why I made it. The next section,Fun Facts, is where I list a handful of facts about 
 Star Trek that, in my opinion, are interesting and/or cool. The third section, Trivia, asks a few 
 questions about the Star Trek series with answers. The final section, Gallery, is a few pictures that, 
 to me, document the show.
